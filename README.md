# Global-Terrorist-Data
The data folder also contain a 62 page PDF file names as “Codebook”. It contain the detail
information about all the abbreviations, IDs, codes used in csv files. For example:
Crit1 stand for Inclusion Criteria – Criterion1, which stand for POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, And
RELIGIOUS, OR SOCIAL GOAL behind the terror attack.
 Nperps stand for Number of Perpetrators. This field indicates the total number of terrorists
participating in the incident. (In the instance of multiple perpetrator groups participating in
one case, the total number of perpetrators, across groups, is recorded). There are often
discrepancies in information on this value. The lowest possible number is recorded, in this
example, “11.” “‐99” or “Unknown” appears when the number of perpetrators is not
reported.
